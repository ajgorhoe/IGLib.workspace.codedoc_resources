# IGLib.workspace.codedoc_resources

This repositort contains the necessary resources for generation of code documentation, namely the binaries of ***[Doxygen](https://gitlab.com/graphviz/graphviz)*** and ***[Graphviz](https://gitlab.com/graphviz/graphviz)***. Binaries distributed by this repository are used in the **[codedoc](https://github.com/ajgorhoe/IGLib.workspace.doc.codedoc)** repository used for generation of code documentation for the **[Investigative Generic Library(IGLib)](https://github.com/ajgorhoe/IGLib.modules.IGLibCore)**, but the *codedoc* repository can b easily adapted to use with any other source code repository (or a large group of repositories, as is the case with *IGLib*).
